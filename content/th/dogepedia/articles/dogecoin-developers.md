The development of Dogecoin is open, permissionless, and participatory. Over the years, a varied group of developers has contributed to the development of Dogecoin Core, Dogecoin's reference implementation.

Dogecoin was created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013. Billy served as the main developer for Dogecoin Core during its initial releases. The Dogecoin Core codebase was largely derived from the work done by Bitcoin developers on the Bitcoin repository.

In 2014, Billy and Jackson left the project. A group of developers replaced them to act as maintainers of the repository. This group, whose composition changed  over the years, coordinated the efforts of more than 40 contributors. New contributors can join the development of Dogecoin Core in the public Github repository, available [here](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin).

Development of the overall ecosystem is also crucial - as if the aim of the reference implementation is to build a solid and stable foundation, innovation can happen through services built on top of it (and at times, in synergy with it). There are many solo developers, organizations, and companies building services on top of the existing Dogecoin Core codebase, including payment channel functionality, experimental support for NFTs, and tipping services. The Dogecoin Foundation repository can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/dogecoinfoundation).

You do not need any authorization or permission to start contributing to Dogecoin Core or to build new services on top of it. If you are interested in becoming a Dogecoin developer, learn more [here](/dogepedia/articles/becoming-a-dogecoin-developer).
