The Dogecoin Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation tasked with providing (i) support for Dogecoin through development and advocacy, (ii) Dogecoin trademark defence to prevent abuse and fraud, and (iii) a roadmap and governance for the future of Dogecoin.  

The Foundation was initially established by members of the Dogecoin team in 2014 to provide governance and support for the Dogecoin project. In 2021 the Foundation was re-invigorated by members of the core development team — along with fresh faces and new seasoned advisors — ready to grow Dogecoin for the decade ahead! 

You can read about the Foundation’s guiding principles in [The Dogecoin Manifesto](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/manifesto/).
