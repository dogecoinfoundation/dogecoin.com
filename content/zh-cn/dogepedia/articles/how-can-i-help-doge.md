There are *so* many ways to get involved and support Dogecoin. From making memes and artworks – to educating people who are new to crypto: there are endless possibilities for you to get involved and to help the Dogecoin movement.  

A good place to start is by joining one or more of the highly active communities on platforms such as [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dogecoin), and [Discord](https://discord.gg/dogecoin).

If you have a technical background and would like to contribute to Dogecoin technical development, you can get involved via [Dogecoin Core](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin) and [The Dogecoin Foundation](https://github.com/dogecoinfoundation) GitHub repositories.  

If you’re interested in volunteering at The Dogecoin Foundation, stay tuned to the [Foundation website](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) for details coming soon!
