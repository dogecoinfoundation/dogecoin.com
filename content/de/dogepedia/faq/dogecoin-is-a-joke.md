It is true that Dogecoin was born as a joke - and this sense of fun should forever remain and never go away! Despite Dogecoin’s genesis as a joke, though, more and more people are beginning to realise Dogecoin’s utilitarian value as a legitimate, efficient, and functional currency.  

Because of this, Dogecoin has now evolved into much *more* than ‘*just* a joke’, whilst still maintaining its LOL attitude. Indeed, as the late and great Sporklin once commented: “Dogecoin can be a joke and still be functional … While the branding is frontal jokes and memes, everything under that has been solid from the start”. 

As a matter of fact, unlike other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin has had its use case, and thus utility, from its inception. A few days after its launch in December 2013, a tipping bot became available, allowing users to easily tip each other on reddit. The speed of the transactions and the low fees made Dogecoin "the" tipping cryptocurrency on reddit, for a while. At the same time, the community also started collecting Dogecoin for many great causes and charitable endeavours.
