The whale in question is an exchange, and so are most of the top holders in the Dogecoin network. As a matter of fact, the infamous largest whale is likely to be Robin Hood - which means it represents assets of tens of thousands of retails investors.

- There is no need to specify which exchanges hold which wallets, but do explain the combination of hot/cold wallets and why exchanges use them.
