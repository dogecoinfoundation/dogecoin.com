Dogecoin is becoming increasingly popular as a payment option by merchants worldwide. Moreover, the implementation of third-party cryptocurrency payment solutions such as Coinbase Commerce and BitPay has resulted in more-and-more businesses accepting Dogecoin. It is also possible for you to indirectly use Dogecoin at merchants who donâ€™t accept Dogecoin. For example, some companies have established relationships with credit card companies in which you can 'top up' a credit card from your Dogecoin crypto wallet. Other companies even facilitate the payments of utilities and bills with Dogecoin.

The Dogecoin community is committed to championing Dogecoin as a legitimate and viable alternative currency to traditional fiat money. To this end, over the years the community has been successful in convincing retailers to **#AcceptDoge** via online campaigns which have received overwhelming support and significant positive exposure for retailers who choose to accept Dogecoin. If you want your favourite stores to accept Dogecoin, then [get involved](/dogepedia/articles/join-the-dogecoin-community) and make your voice known!
