The OG Dogecoin Core Team formed shortly afterwards, comprised of Max Keller, Michi Lumin, Patrick Lodder, Ross Nicoll, and Sporklin (RIP), who have maintained Dogecoin Core for the past 8-years. Today this is also comprised of a range of amazing volunteers, including Ed Tubbs and Bluezr. 

The Dogecoin Foundation Development Team consists of OG Developers including Michi Lumin and Ross Nicoll, and includes Timothy Stebbing as Product Lead, and a multitude of volunteers, including teenagers from the much amaze Hack Club! It also has Max Keller and Billy Markus as Advisors.  

Within the Dogecoin ecosystem, there are also a number of exciting projects underway with some Doge dedicated developers and people involved. For example, the MyDoge team which is headed by Bill Lee includes the much impressive developers Alex Lewis and Jordan Jefferson.
