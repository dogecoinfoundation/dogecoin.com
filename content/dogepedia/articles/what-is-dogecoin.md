Dogecoin is many things to many different people. At its heart, Dogecoin is the accidental crypto **movement** that makes people smile! 

It is also an open-source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that utilises [blockchain technology](https://www.dogecoin.com/dogepedia/articles/what-is-a-blockchain), a highly secure decentralised system of storing information as a public ledger that is maintained by a network of computers called [nodes](https://www.dogecoin.com/dogepedia/articles/what-is-a-node). 

More than this, though, is the ethos of Dogecoin, summarised in the [Dogecoin Manifesto](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/manifesto/), and its amazing, vibrant community made up of friendly folks just like you!  

The Dogecoin community cares about supporting each other, being kind, teaching people about cryptocurrency, fundraising, having fun, making memes, and being absurd. This is nicely captured by Dogecoin’s unofficial tagline: **D**o **O**nly **G**ood **E**veryday.  

Moreover, the Dogecoin community is passionate about championing Dogecoin as a viable and legitimate alternative currency to traditional fiat money. To this end, the Dogecoin ecosystem is ever-expanding in dynamic and organic ways, and aims to become a highly utilised currency of the People, for the People, whilst always staying true to its origin of being the most fun crypto! 

At its core, Dogecoin is useful, personable, welcoming, and reliable – and we’re very happy you’re here.
