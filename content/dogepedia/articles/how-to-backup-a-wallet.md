A wallet is just a collection of *private keys* and *public keys*. 

Each one of the wallet’s private keys is a randomised 256-bit number unique to your wallet, and it is what you need to be able to access and spend your coins. Your public address - the address which other Dogecoin wallets can use to send Dogecoin to your wallet - is a hashed version of the public key associated with the private key.

Most Dogecoin holders use some kind of [*wallet application*](/dogepedia/articles/how-do-i-get-a-wallet), like Dogecoin Core, or devices like [*hardware wallets*](/dogepedia/articles/dogecoin-hardware-wallets/) to manage their wallets. Each of these might involve a different process to generate a backup. 

### Wallet Backups with Dogecoin Core

Dogecoin Core, the software used to run a Dogecoin node, is often used as a wallet application. In order to create a backup with Dogecoin Core, follow these steps:

- (Optional, but recommended) First, encrypt your wallet. To do so, go to Settings -> Encrypt wallet. You will be asked to enter a password. It is crucial that you store this password somewhere safe and that you never lose it. Without it, you will be unable to access the funds in your encrypted wallet. On the other hand, this password adds an extra layer of security to your backup. Without it, even if an attacker gains access to your wallet file, he will still be unable to spend your Dogecoin.
- Go to File -> Backup Wallet. This will generate a wallet.dat file, which stores a list of all the key pairs you have used. Restoring this file will give you access to your Dogecoin. Store it somewhere safe, in a device not connected to the internet.

### Wallet Backups with Wallets Using Seed Phrases

Many modern wallets rely on the use of a seed phrase. A seed phrases — also called “mnemonic phrase” or “mnemonic seed” — *usually* consists of a sequence of 12 or 24 words. Every seed phrase is unique and identifies a distinct wallet where a certain amount of Dogecoin might be stored. A seed phrase acts as a sort of master key which the wallet software uses to calculate all the private keys (and public addresses) needed to access and spend the Doge you are holding.

It is crucial that you backup your seed phrase and that you store it in multiple secure locations, where nobody but you can access it. Anyone who knows your seed phrase will have full access to your Dogecoin. This is why you should never, under any circumstance, share your seed phrase or private key with anyone that you do not trust. 

**Remember**: 
- **It is always more secure to ensure that your seed phrase or private keys are stored on a device that is NOT connected to the internet.** [*Hardware wallets*](/dogepedia/articles/dogecoin-hardware-wallets/) offer a way to store your coins safely while also being able to access them easily, if needed.
- Your wallet’s private keys (or seed phrase) grant the holder access to your Dogecoin – no matter what wallet you use.
- Dogecoin transactions are permanent, so there would be no way to recover any Dogecoin that an attacker has stolen from your wallet.
