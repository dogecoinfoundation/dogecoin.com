A wallet is a set of private keys that gives you access to the control of certain coins on the blockchain ledger. When you spend a coin, control of that coin is transferred from being controlled by your keys to being controlled by someone else's keys. Wallets simply hold your keys and tell you how many coins they control. 

A wallet app is an application which manages these keys, reports these amounts, and facilitates the transfer of amounts of coins between addresses. Some store your keys locally, others use their own keys on a remote server (which is less safe). Just remember: *whoever has the keys controls the coins*.  

While some "custodial" services, where coins that are "yours" are held under their keys may indeed be trustworthy, keep in mind that many are not, and unless you hold the keys, ultimately, the only thing keeping whoever *does* hold the keys from transferring your coins, is trust.
