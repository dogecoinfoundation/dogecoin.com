Privacy is an interesting topic, and one in which Dogecoin community members are actively involved. For starters, it’s worthwhile acknowledging that every transaction on the blockchain is public. That is, it’s possible for anyone to see any Dogecoin transaction that has ever been made if you have the public wallet address! This is why, if you wish to remain anonymous, it’s important not to claim any public address as yours. 

If you have a [hardware wallet](/dogepedia/articles/dogecoin-hardware-wallets), you can create new randomised public addresses for new transactions after the previous transaction has occurred. Some people prefer to do this for anonymity and privacy reasons, and you can even create several accounts under the same [seed phrase](/dogepedia/articles/how-to-backup-a-wallet) so that Dogecoin can be stored in different accounts according to their purpose (for example, account 1 for daily transactions, account 2 for charity, etc). 

Ultimately, though, it’s important to remember that the [blockchain](/dogepedia/articles/what-is-a-blockchain) is a **public** ledger, and it’s possible to see all Dogecoin transactions that have occurred over time. Moreover, even if public addresses aren’t directly associated with people or organisations, there may come a point in the future whereby computer scientists are able to de-anonymise public address and link them to their owner.
