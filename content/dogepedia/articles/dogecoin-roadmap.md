While a 'roadmap' is a term that's commonly used when new cryptocurrencies are released, it also conveys a rigid way forward, led by a single ‘company’ or ‘lead developer’.  

Dogecoin is a community-driven, consensus based open-source project and its direction is formed by the many individual and organisational contributors to the various projects of the Dogecoin blockchain & ecosystem.  

The direction of Dogecoin is paved by the [many projects](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/trailmap/) that the community feels best shapes its direction. This is a very intentional decision: it is important that Dogecoin remains a decentralised project with shepherds rather than rulers, each whose projects and contributions stand or fall on their merits.  

*But what about the Dogecoin Foundation, don’t they have a ‘roadmap’?*  

The Dogecoin Foundation participates in the same consensus-based participatory process as any one individual or group in the Dogecoin community. The Dogecoin Foundation [Trailmap](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/trailmap/) includes projects that the Foundation is committed to developing which it believes are beneficial to the success of Dogecoin.
