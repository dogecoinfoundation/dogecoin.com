The past year has seen a wave of businesses starting to accept Dogecoin for goods and services. Thanks to a multitude of crypto payment solutions, now it’s as easy as ever for your business to accept Dogecoin.  

At the most foundational level, for your business to accept Dogecoin in exchange for goods and services you will require a [wallet](/dogepedia/articles/how-do-i-get-a-wallet).

If you have a bricks-and-mortar business where payments are made in person, it’s common for merchants to print a QR code that is scanned by customers’ smartphones to streamline the transaction process.  

If you have an ecommerce store, companies like Coinbase Commerce and BitPay make accepting Dogecoin a breeze, and include integrations with popular platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and OpenCart. It is also possible to develop custom solutions connecting directly to a [Dogecoin Core node](/dogepedia/how-tos/operating-a-node/) through the JSON-RPC interface. The Dogecoin Foundation is currently developing [Libdogecoin](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/trailmap/libdogecoin/), a library that will, among other things, facilitate and standardize the implementation of Dogecoin payments.

There are also complete open source solutions being currently developed by independent developers in the Dogecoin community, such as [DogeGarden](https://dogegarden.io/).
