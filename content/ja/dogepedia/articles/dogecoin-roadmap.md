While a 'roadmap' is a term that's commonly used when new cryptocurrencies are released, 
it also conveys a rigid way forward, led by a single ‘company’ or ‘lead developer’.  

Dogecoin is a community-driven, consensus based open-source project and its direction is 
formed by the many individual and organisational contributors to the various projects of 
the Dogecoin blockchain & ecosystem.  

The direction of Dogecoin is paved by the [many projects](/dogepedia/projects/) that the 
community feels best shape its direction. This is very intentional: it is important 
that Dogecoin remains a decentralised project with shepherds rather than rulers, whose projects 
and contributions stand or fall on their merits.  

The Dogecoin Core software sits at the center of this ecosystem. The development happens in the
[Dogecoin Core Github Repository](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin). 
The [Dogecoin Core Projects Page](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/projects) acts as a tracker
of Dogecoin Core's technical development. For the purpose of reaching consensus around the 
development of Dogecoin Core, the community often relies on the [Dogecoin Development 
Reddit community](https://reddit.com/r/dogecoindev) and on the
[Dogecoin Core Github Repository's Discussion Pages](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/discussions).

*But what about the Dogecoin Foundation, don’t they have a ‘roadmap’?*  

The Dogecoin Foundation participates in the same consensus-based participatory process as any one 
individual or group in the Dogecoin community. The Dogecoin Foundation maintains a 
[Trailmap](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/trailmap/), which includes projects that the Foundation 
is committed to developing and which it believes are beneficial to the success of Dogecoin.
