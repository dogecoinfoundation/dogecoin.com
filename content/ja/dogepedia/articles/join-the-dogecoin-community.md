There are many ways you can get involved in the Dogecoin community! Most popular social-media platforms have a thriving and welcoming Dogecoin community through which newcomers and old-timers alike can connect, discuss, and share their thoughts, memes, ideas, and spread the joy of all things Doge. 

**Reddit** and **Twitter** are the most popular platforms for the Dogecoin community, with millions of active Shibes on either platform. 

On Reddit, **[r/dogecoin](https://reddit.com/r/dogecoin/)** is so popular that in 2021 it was ranked as Reddit’s Top community for cryptocurrency and finance, and posts in the Dogecoin subreddit are frequently the most upvoted posts for the entire Reddit platform! If you are more technically inclined and want to stay updated about Dogecoin development, you can also check out the technical development subreddit at **[r/dogecoindev](https://reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/)**. **[r/dogeducation](https://reddit.com/r/dogeducation/)** is another subreddit where new Dogecoin users can find How-Tos and help.

One of the many awesome things about Dogecoin — and what differentiates it from many crypto communities — is the amazing and massive community of Shibes around the world. No matter where you look, you’re bound to find a welcoming Dogecoin community somewhere.
