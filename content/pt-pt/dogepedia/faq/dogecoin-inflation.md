Dogecoin has a diminished inflation rate because it has a fixed yearly issuance of 5 billion coins. This means that each year, the rate of inflation **decreases** comparative to the total supply, and in a very predictable way, making Dogecoin the perfect candidate to be used as a currency.  

Since Dogecoin is not meant to be hoarded — and hoarding is a major barrier to a crypto**currency** being used as, well, an actual **currency** — Dogecoin will have a much more utilitarian and practical place in the economy than other cryptocurrencies, which often remain unspent.
