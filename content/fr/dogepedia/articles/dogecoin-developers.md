Although development of Dogecoin is open and participatory, there is still a strong group of key developers who maintain and contribute to the Dogecoin blockchain and ecosystem.  

Dogecoin was created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013, and Billy worked on Dogecoin as its principal developer for its first releases.  

The OG Dogecoin Core Team formed shortly afterwards, composed of Max Keller, Michi Lumin, Patrick Lodder, Ross Nicoll, and Sporklin (RIP), who have maintained Dogecoin Core for the past 8 years. Today, this is also comprised of a range of amazing volunteers, including Ed Tubbs, Bluezr, and Chromatic. Overall, nearly 40 developers have contributed to recent Dogecoin releases.

The Dogecoin Foundation Development Team includes OG Developer Michi Lumin, and also has OG Developers Max Keller and Ross Nicoll — and Billy Markus — as Principal Advisors. The development team also includes Timothy Stebbing as Product Lead and Bluezr as Dogecoin blockchain expert, in addition to an awesome array of volunteers, including teenagers from the much amaze Hack Club! 

Within the Dogecoin ecosystem, there are also a number of exciting projects underway with some Doge-dedicated developers and people involved. For example, the MyDoge team, headed by Bill Lee and including Alex Lewis and Jordan Jefferson, has been developing an easy-to-use wallet for mobile platforms exclusively for Dogecoin. Many independent developers are building new services on top of the existing Dogecoin Core codebase, including payment channel functionality, experimental support for NFTs, and tipping services. 

As the Dogecoin ecosystem continues to evolve, we will need more developers to #BUIDL the future of the Peoples’ crypto! If you are interested in becoming a Dogecoin developer, learn more [here](/dogepedia/articles/becoming-a-dogecoin-developer).
