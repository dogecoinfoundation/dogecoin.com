Each one of the wallet’s private keys is a randomised 256-bit number unique to your wallet, and it is what you need to be able to access and spend your coins. Your public address - the address which other Dogecoin wallets can use to send Dogecoin to your wallet - is a hashed version of the public key associated with the private key.</description></item><item><title>A whale holds nearly 30% of Dogecoin supply! Is this true?</title><link>/zh-tw/dogepedia/faq/dogecoin-whale-wallets/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-tw/dogepedia/faq/dogecoin-whale-wallets/</guid><description>A common source of FUD surrounding Dogecoin is the claim that certain wallets holding a large percentage of the supply are owned by private investors or so-called &amp;ldquo;whales&amp;rdquo;. In reality, many of the top Dogecoin wallets are cold wallets or hot wallets controlled by exchanges and brokers, and they thus represent Dogecoin held in custody for thousands - or hundreds of thousands, even - of people.
To those accustomed to blockchain analysis, many of those wallets appear as wallets managed by trading platforms, as they exhibit patterns of activity and volume that were typical of crypto exchanges or brokerage services holding large amounts of collateral.</description></item><item><title>How can I become a Dogecoin developer?</title><link>/zh-tw/dogepedia/articles/becoming-a-dogecoin-developer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-tw/dogepedia/articles/becoming-a-dogecoin-developer/</guid><description>Dogecoin is an open-source project, meaning that anyone with some technical know-how can contribute to Dogecoin’s technical development. Even if you’re new to the space, it’s never too late to learn new tricks!
Dogecoin has an amazing team of developers and volunteers who are committed to welcoming new people into the space and helping them to learn and develop their skills. The community is extremely encouraging, too, and it’s very common to see old Shibes helping new Shibes as they enter the space.</description></item><item><title>狗狗幣沒有用處！</title><link>/zh-tw/dogepedia/faq/dogecoin-has-no-utility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-tw/dogepedia/faq/dogecoin-has-no-utility/</guid><description>噢，當然有啊，而且一直都有！一個簡單的事實是：錢是有用處的 - 而狗狗幣就是錢！事實上狗狗幣是為數不多、從一開始就爲了這一目標而生的加密貨幣之一。
狗狗幣在起初只是個玩笑 - 它在過去很好地遵循了這個傳統，在未來也會繼續。它幾乎是從一開始就被當作一種給小費的途徑，以及鼓勵人們做一些有意義的事情：贊助牙買加雪橇隊參加冬奧會、建造肯亞水井、建造狗狗賽車以及許多狗狗幣社群支持的瘋狂提案。狗狗幣始終保持了它誕生之初的用途 - 作為一種打賞貨幣，因爲相較於同期的其他貨幣，狗狗幣區塊鏈的交易費用低廉，且交易速度快速。
經過多年發展，在網路商店使用狗狗幣進行消費已經成為可能。隨著第三方廠商（如 BitPay、Coinbase）整合了狗狗幣支付、部分預付卡供應商支援狗狗幣做爲資金來源，狗狗幣的使用在過去 2 年呈現了爆炸性成長。商店還可以通過 JSON-RPC 介面直接整合到狗狗幣區塊鏈上。狗狗幣基金會正在與開發者們計劃透過建立一些流程化、標準化導入方式的函式庫，來使得前述做法更加便捷。
我們正在進行開發，以增強狗狗幣相較其他加密貨幣在實用性上的優勢。隨著好幾個團隊持續建設狗狗幣及其生態，狗狗幣還將找到新的實用場景。
根據狗狗幣宣言，狗狗幣專注於實用、風度翩翩、熱情友好以及穩健，同時要保持獨特的趣味感。</description></item><item><title>How Does Dogecoin Work?</title><link>/zh-tw/dogepedia/articles/how-does-dogecoin-work/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-tw/dogepedia/articles/how-does-dogecoin-work/</guid><description>Magic and memes! (Just kidding. Kind of.)
First things first: Dogecoin is money.
Like other popular cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin works by utilising blockchain technology. Unlike a lot of other popular cryptocurrencies, though, the fees to send Dogecoin are extremely small, and the speed by which Dogecoin transactions are confirmed is relatively fast.
Simply put, if you would like to send money to someone who is located anywhere in the world — or receive money from someone who is located anywhere in the world — without using a centralised bank and paying foreign currency exchange and transfer fees, then Dogecoin can work for you!</description></item><item><title>What is a mining pool?</title><link>/zh-tw/dogepedia/articles/what-is-a-mining-pool/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-tw/dogepedia/articles/what-is-a-mining-pool/</guid><description>Mining pools are services, operated by third parties not affiliated with Dogecoin, which allow a group of miners to combine their hashing power when attempting to solve the &amp;ldquo;puzzles&amp;rdquo; involved in mining Dogecoin.
Mining rewards - consisting of 10,000 Dogecoin per block plus transaction fees associated to the transactions included in the block - are awarded to the miner who discovers a valid Proof of Work for a new block before any other miner in the network.</description></item><item><title>Operate a Dogecoin Node</title><link>/zh-tw/dogepedia/how-tos/operating-a-node/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-tw/dogepedia/how-tos/operating-a-node/</guid><description>The Dogecoin network is a peer-to-peer payment network consisting of thousands of computers called nodes. Each of these nodes is running specialized software. Dogecoin Core, Dogecoin&amp;rsquo;s reference implementation, is the software more commonly used to run a Dogecoin node. It can be downloaded from the official Dogecoin.com website and directly from the Github repository.
Running a full node is a service that volunteers in the network, called node operators, provide to the Dogecoin community.</description></item><item><title>Can you put a cap on Dogecoin?</title><link>/zh-tw/dogepedia/faq/putting-a-cap-on-dogecoin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-tw/dogepedia/faq/putting-a-cap-on-dogecoin/</guid><description>Right now, and for the next hundred years or so, Dogecoin operates like, and will continue to operate like, most other crypto assets. “Capped” assets are nowhere near mined out – and will continue adding to their supply, just like Dogecoin, for the foreseeable future.
Dogecoin’s supply is not unlimited, because it has an absolute limit of issuance per block, per day, per year – just like other coins do. The only difference is that Dogecoin’s issuance does not have an end date.</description></item><item><title>Charities Accepting Doge</title><link>/zh-tw/dogepedia/articles/charities-accepting-doge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-tw/dogepedia/articles/charities-accepting-doge/</guid><description>Dogecoin’s history includes many charitable endeavours: from funding clean water wells in 2014 for Kenya, to the #TeamSeas initiative in 2021 – and many worthwhile causes in-between. The past year, though, has seen a dramatic increase in charities directly accepting Dogecoin donations – which is very much wow!
Organisations like The Giving Block make it super easy for charities to accept Dogecoin and other cryptocurrency donations. Initiatives like The Water Project — which has been accepting Dogecoin for over 6-years — now use The Giving Block to accept Dogecoin donations to fund fully monitored water projects in Africa.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin and Privacy</title><link>/zh-tw/dogepedia/articles/dogecoin-and-privacy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-tw/dogepedia/articles/dogecoin-and-privacy/</guid><description>Privacy is an interesting topic, and one in which Dogecoin community members are actively involved. For starters, it’s worthwhile acknowledging that every transaction on the blockchain is public. That is, it’s possible for anyone to see any Dogecoin transaction that has ever been made if you have the public wallet address! This is why, if you wish to remain anonymous, it’s important not to claim any public address as yours.</description></item></channel></rss>
