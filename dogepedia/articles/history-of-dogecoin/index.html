Jackson created the Dogecoin.com website and would have been, for a while, the public face of Dogecoin, while Billy worked as a solo developer on the first 4 releases.</p><p><img src=../../../assets/images/dogepedia/12.png alt="image info"></p><p>On December 6th, 2013, Dogecoin was launched taking influence from the famous Doge meme: an image of a very adorable Shiba Inu dog with multi-coloured comic sans text that appears as the dog’s “thought bubbles”.</p><p>This famous meme was based on a 2010 photograph of a Japanese female Shiba Inu dog called <strong>Kabosu</strong>, who was adopted by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Satō from an animal shelter in 2008.</p><p>Much to Billy and Jackson’s surprise, Dogecoin was a near-instant success, and gained tremendous popularity on sites such as Reddit, where it was —and still is — used as a tipping currency. When Dogecoin was just 2-weeks old, it reached more transactions per day than Bitcoin. Moreover, within the first month there were over one-million unique visitors to this website!</p><p>In 2014, both Billy and Jackson left the development efforts, while a Dogecoin Core Development team was formed. The team, comprised of a small group of core maintainers and supported by more than 40 contributors over the years, has been maintaining and developing Dogecoin since then.</p><p>Although owing its genesis to a joke, Dogecoin quickly developed into a massive and passionate cryptocurrency community. This fun and friendly crypto community has also been behind many great causes and charitable endeavours.</p><p>For example, in 2014 the Dogecoin community raised 26.5 million Dogecoin (worth around USD $30,000.00 at the time) to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Sochi Winter Olympics! In March of that year, the Dogecoin community also raised over 40 million Dogecoin (worth around USD $30,000.00 at the time) to help with the effort of building clean-water wells in Kenya.</p><p>Most recently, the <a href=https://foundation.dogecoin.com/>Dogecoin Foundation</a> partnered with popular YouTubers Mr Beast and Mark Rober for their TeamSeas initiative: with the ambitious aim to raise a combined 30 million U.S. dollars to remove 30 million pounds of trash from the world’s oceans.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer><div class=footer-container><img class=footer-image src=/footer-map.png><div class=footer-row><div class=footer-column1><div class=logo><img src=/doge-logo.png alt="Dogecoin logo"><div class=logo-labels><div class="main-label footer-label">DOGECOIN</div></div></div><p>The Shiba Inu is a Japanese breed of dog that was popularized as an online meme and represents Dogecoin.
