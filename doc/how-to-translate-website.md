### Markdown Editor
* Any mainstrem markdown editor is suitable for processing the translation tasks.

## Update config.toml

* Open file '```config.toml```' at root path.
* Add according language (eg. translated-lang) in ```[languages]``` section.
* Add menu items of Home Page in your 'translated-lang' section (eg. ```zh-cn``` is ```[languages.zh-cn.menu]``` and following ```[[languages.zh-cn.menu.main]]```).

## Update langFlags.yaml

* Open file '```data/langFlags.yaml```'.
* Add according language (eg. translated-lang) in ```langFlags.yaml```.

## Create/Update translated-lang.toml

* Create file if it does NOT exist '```i18n/translated-lang/```' (eg. '```i18n/zh-cn/```').
* Update file if it does exist '```i18n/translated-lang/```' (eg. '```i18n/zh-cn/```').


## Translation

* Copy the original english (markdown format) files (eg. ```about.md```) and paste as the to-be-translated-files (eg. ```translated-lang/about.md```), translate them then.
* If there are some updates on the ```main``` branch during your translating process, you should merge them to your personal-trans-branch first (resolve conflicts as well), to make sure your translation is update-to-date.

## Test translation

* Run the website locally by following the steps in [How To Run Dogecoin Website](how-to-run-website.md) to test the translation, make sure it will work as expected.

## Pull Request

* Submit changes as PR, then mention your PR in the channel ```website``` on Discord.


## PR Review

* It's ideal to do ```peer review``` if there are at least TWO peers who are familiar with the same language translations.
* If ONLY the translator is familiar with the translated laguage, then there should be at least another TWO reviewer to be requested to do the review task.

## Merge to main branch

* Once the review PASS, then the ORIGINAL translator should do the ```merge``` action from ```personal-lang-trans-branch``` to ```main``` branch.
* Remember to resolve conflict if there happens.
