## Install Hugo

### Install on Windows

#### Set up Your Directories 

You’ll need a place to store the Hugo executable:

* Open Windows Explorer.
* Create a new folder: ```C:\Hugo```, assuming you want Hugo on your C drive, although this can go anywhere.
* Create a subfolder in the Hugo folder: ```C:\Hugo\bin```.

#### Get Hugo

* Go to the Hugo Releases page: [https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases).
* The latest release is announced on top. Scroll to the bottom of the release announcement to see the downloads. They’re all ZIP files.
* Find the Windows files near the bottom (they’re in alphabetical order, so Windows is last) – download either the 32-bit or 64-bit file depending on whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows. 
* Move the ZIP file into your ```C:\Hugo\bin``` folder.
* Double-click on the ZIP file and extract its contents. Be sure to extract the contents into the same ```C:\Hugo\bin``` folder – Windows will do this by default unless you tell it to extract somewhere else.

#### Add Hugo to Windows PATH

* Right click on the **Start** button.
* Click on **System**.
* Click on **Advanced System Settings** on the left.
* Click on the **Environment Variables…** button on the bottom.
* In the User variables section, find the row that starts with PATH (PATH will be all caps).
* Double-click on **PATH**.
* Click the **New…** button.
* Type in the folder where hugo.exe was extracted, which is ```C:\Hugo\bin``` if you went by the instructions above. The PATH entry should be the folder where Hugo lives and not the binary. Press Enter when you’re done typing.
* Click OK at every window to exit.

#### Verify the Executable

* Open a Command Prompt 
* Type ```hugo help``` and press the Enter key. You should see output like this:
```
